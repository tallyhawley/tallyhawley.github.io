The index.js file is a selfbot and is not permitted by discord
Use at your own risk

The .env file needs your [token = DiscordUserToken] and [ID = DiscordUserID]
DO NOT SHARE YOUR TOKEN WITH ANYONE
DO NOT UPLOAD YOUR TOKEN TO GITHUB

If you fork this directory and edit the .env file remember to create a .gitignore file and place the .env file in it

The congif.json file only needs you to edit "self"
Place the channel(s) you want to use in the "channel_ids" array
Choose your prefix and place it in the "prefix" array

To get the most up to date bundle list you need to head over to the Mudae World Discord and run the command $bundlelist
Mudatest will then send you all the bundles
Then just replace the info in bundlelist.txt with the data that Mudatest gave you
Then run the bundleListToMessages.py file which will update the msgToSend.txt file with the new commands

After that you should be able to run the index.js file
To start sending the messages in the msgToSend.txt file use the command {prefix}send in your selected channel
This will take a long time (Took 6.5 hours last time I updated it)

And then finally after the bot is done running you can turn it off and run reformatter.py
This will remove the asterisks (italicization) on the aliases
(This can be done with slicing in index.js if you want, but using regex will not work since some bundles have asterisks in their title) 
And pretty print the JSON to newBundles.json

And there you have it, the new bundles in JSON form ready to replace the old data
